# Build-for-Impact-Hackathon
Hackathon Repo for 23/05/2025

** Problem Statement **

- feeling disconnected or lonely
- not making the most of uni
- clubs & socities
- efficiency of event planning, fragmented communication.

IDEATE: 
- think of a concrete solution.

ASSESS:
- determine your solution's desirability, practicality -> why should they consider?

PITCH:
- create an engaging slide deck and deliver a pitch.

Judging Criteria: 

1. Impact: How much real difference will your solution make in solving the problem? Judges will look for ideas that have the potential to create meaningful, lasting change - not just in theory, but in the lives of students at UQ.
   
2. Desirability: Do people actually want this? Strong entries will show that students care about the problem and are genuinely interested in the solution, backed by evidence like surveys, interviews, or direct feedback.

3. Practicality: Is your idea realistically achievable, and is it easy for users to engage with? This includes how feasible it is to develop **(bonus points for working prototypes)** and how smoothly it fits into students everyday life.

4. Creativity: How original, bold, or unexpected is your approach
